# Access-to-Data-using-PIC-SURE-API: BCH_Precision_Link_Biobank

## Get your security token

**In order to be able to run any one of these examples, you'll need to get a personal user security token**. This is the way the API grants access to individual users to protected-access data. **The user token is strictly personal, be careful not to share it with anyone**.

To get your token, process as follows:
1. In a web browser, open the PIC-SURE UI login page: https://precisionlink-biobank4discovery.childrens.harvard.edu/picsureui/, and click on the 'Boston Childrens Hospital' button to log in. Follow the instructions to complete the login process.
2. On the user-interface click the USER PROFILE tab
3. On the pop-up window, click on REFRESH and then COPY
4. Back into your Jupyter environment, create a text file called `token.txt` into the python and/or R folders and paste the token into it.
