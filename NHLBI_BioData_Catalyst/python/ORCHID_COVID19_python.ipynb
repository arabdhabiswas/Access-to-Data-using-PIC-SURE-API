    "- 1, Dead\n",
    "- 2, Hospitalized on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO\n",
    "- 3, Hospitalized on non-invasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannula\n",
    "- 4, Hospitalized on supplemental oxygen\n",

    "- 6, Not hospitalized with limitation in activity (continued symptoms)\n",

    "This scale will also be assessed at different timepoints as secondary outcomes: day-3, day-7, and day-28.\n",

    "Other secondary outcomes will be considered. Death, and composite of death and ECMO will be analyzed using logistic regression models. Time to recovery (patient without oxygen supplementation -- ie COS level 6 or 7) and time to discharge will be analyzed using survival models. Support free-days (hospital, oxygen, ICU, ventilation, and vasopressor) will be treated as ordered factors and analyzed using proportional odds regression models.\n",
