There are no overlaps in subjects in the MESA Classic Exam datasets and the MESA Family Exam datasets. However, many of the phenotype measurements are shared betweeen the MESA Classic and MESA Family Exams. Variables included in the MESA Family Exam are those from standard questionnaires, clinical and laboratory measurements. The questionnaires include variables of demography, socioeconomic and psychosocial status, medical and family history, medication use, dietary and alcohol intakes, smoking, and physical activity. The clinical measurements include anthropometry, blood pressure, ankle/brachial blood pressure indices, ECG, coronary calcium determination, carotid ultrasound, arterial wave forms, flow-dependent brachial artery vasodilation, and cardiac MRI. Laboratory measurements include various lipids, cytokines, adhesion molecules, NO, and hemostasis/fibrinolysis markers.\\\\EXAM 1 FASTING GLUCOSE- CALIBRATED\\\\',\n",

However, many of the phenotype measurements are shared betweeen the MESA Classic and MESA Air Exams. Variables included in the MESA Air Exam are those from standard questionnaires, clinical and laboratory measurements. The questionnaires include variables of demography, socioeconomic and psychosocial status, medical and family history, medication use, dietary and alcohol intakes, smoking, and physical activity. The clinical measurements include anthropometry, blood pressure, ankle/brachial blood pressure indices, ECG, coronary calcium determination, arterial wave forms, and flow-dependent brachial artery vasodilation.

There are no overlaps in subjects in between MESA Classic Exam datasets, MESA Family Exam datasets, and MESA AIR Exam datasets. However, many of the phenotype measurements are shared betweeen the MESA Classic and MESA Air Exams. Variables included in the MESA Air Exam are those from standard questionnaires, clinical and laboratory measurements. The questionnaires include variables of demography, socioeconomic and psychosocial status, medical and family history, medication use, dietary and alcohol intakes, smoking, and physical activity. The clinical measurements include anthropometry, blood pressure, ankle/brachial blood pressure indices, ECG, coronary calcium determination, arterial wave forms, and flow-dependent brachial artery vasodilation. Laboratory measurements include various lipids, cytokines, adhesion molecules, NO, and hemostasis/fibrinolysis markers.\\\\SEASON OF EXAM 1\\\\',\n",
