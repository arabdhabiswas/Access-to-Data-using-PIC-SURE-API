    "\n",
    "PIC-SURE stands for Patient-centered Information Commons: Standardized Unification of Research Elements. Original data exposed through PIC-SURE API encompasses a large heterogeneity of data organization underneath. PIC-SURE hides this complexity and exposes the different study datasets in a single tabular format. By simplifying the process of data extraction, it allows investigators to focus on the downstream analyses and to facilitate reproducible sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More about PIC-SURE\n",
    "The API is available in two different programming languages, python and R, allowing investigators to query datasets in the same way using either of language. The R/python PIC-SURE API is a small part of the entire PIC-SURE platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API is actively developed by the Avillach Lab at Harvard Medical School.\n",
